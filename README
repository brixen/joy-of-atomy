These are exercises and code examples from "The Joy of Clojure" by Fogus and
Houser written in Atomy (http://atomy-lang.org). Atomy is still a work in
progress but I find it to be one of the most interesting languages around.

There is also a Ruby library that implements various persistent data
structures call Hamster (https://github.com/harukizaemon/hamster/)
